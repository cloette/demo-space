# Home Assessment
### A quick responsive site to allow for easy, objective, and weighted measurements of houses. 

It probably will come in handy for other things, too.

I could use an excel sheet for this, but that's a terrible mobile experience.

## Plan 
Heroku hosting, Postgres to store scores and scored items, and I'll probably use Auth0 or Passport to do a basic auth check. The data's not sensitive for my use case but I'd rather someone not be able to stumble on it and mess with it, either.

Assessment Fields should be customizable for the user - 
Ex.1 - I need an extra field to put in HOA dues (if applicable).
Ex.2 - I no longer want to weigh price as 3x as important. I should be able to set the multiplier to zero, too, if I want to compare houses independent of price.
* ! Blank Fields should be removed from the denominator/max possible when calculating scores!

## Contributing
Feel free to pitch in! Just give me a heads up.

## Licensing
Just don't try to sell it. If that's not your goal, you're good to copy away.
